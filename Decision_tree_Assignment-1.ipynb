    "However, precision is more useful when we want to affirm the correctness of our model. For example, in the case of YouTube recommendations, reducing the number of false positives is of utmost importance. False positives here represent videos that the user does not like, but YouTube is still recommending them. False negatives are of lesser importance here since the YouTube recommendations should only contain videos that the user is more likely to click on. If the user sees recommendations that are not of their liking, they will close the application, which is not what YouTube desires. Most automated marketing campaigns require a high precision value to ensure that a large number of potential customers will interact with their survey or be interested to learn more."

    "Certainly! Let's consider a classification problem where recall is the most important metric: Credit Card Fraud Detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: Credit Card Fraud Detection**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the domain of credit card transactions, detecting fraudulent transactions is of paramount importance. The two classes in this binary classification problem are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Positive Class (Class 1): Fraudulent transactions.\n",
    "- Negative Class (Class 0): Legitimate, non-fraudulent transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's why recall is the most important metric in this credit card fraud detection scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Minimizing False Negatives:**\n",
    "   - False negatives in this context mean that the fraud detection system fails to identify a fraudulent transaction, allowing it to go through. Missing a true positive case of fraud can result in financial losses for both customers and the credit card company.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Detecting All Instances of Fraud:**\n",
    "   - The primary goal is to ensure that as many fraudulent transactions as possible are correctly identified. Recall measures the ability of the model to correctly identify all instances of the positive class (fraudulent transactions) among all actual positive instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Trade-off with Precision:**\n",
    "   - While recall is crucial, there is often a trade-off with precision. Emphasizing recall might result in more false positives (legitimate transactions incorrectly flagged as fraud), but the goal is to minimize the chances of missing any fraud.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Financial and Reputation Impact:**\n",
    "   - Fraudulent transactions can lead to significant financial losses for both credit card companies and cardholders. Additionally, failing to detect fraud can damage the reputation and trustworthiness of the credit card issuer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Regulatory and Legal Compliance:**\n",
    "   - Credit card companies are often subject to regulations and legal requirements to detect and prevent fraud. High recall helps ensure compliance with these requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this credit card fraud detection example, recall is the most important metric because the primary objective is to identify and prevent as many fraudulent transactions as possible. While maximizing recall may result in some false positives (legitimate transactions being flagged as fraud), the priority is to avoid missing any true cases of fraud, which can have severe financial and reputational consequences."

    "### Example 2:\n",
    "In the case of COVID-19 detection, we want to avoid false negatives as much as possible. COVID-19 spreads easily, and thus we want the patient to take appropriate measures to prevent the spread. A false negative case means that a COVID-positive patient is assessed to not have the disease, which is detrimental. In this use case, false positives (a healthy patient diagnosed as COVID-positive) are not as important as preventing a contagious patient from spreading the disease. In most high-risk disease detection cases (like cancer), recall is a more important evaluation metric than precision."
